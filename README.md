### Hi there; I'm Thomas 😁👋

#### 🔭 Currently working on

##### ACTIVE

- ⭐ **[Cadence](https://github.com/tpucci/cadence)** my current secret project. I build it in public and tweet about it.

##### DONE

- ⭐ **[Intro To Animating Things With Jetpack Compose](https://github.com/tpucci/intro-to-animating-things-jetpack-compose)** the project of my talk about micro-interactions in Jetpack Compose.

##### ON HOLD

- **[kstate](https://github.com/tpucci/kstate)** | A Kotlin multiplatform library to create [xstate](https://xstate.js.org/docs/) like state-machines on any platform (and planning to use it for a [no-nav app](https://app.livestorm.co/thiga-1/lpcx-online-comment-ameliorer-son-nps-grace-au-no-nav-retour-dexperience-avec-bam)).
- **[react-nonav](https://github.com/tpucci/react-nonav)** | An experimental library to change the way we think about navigation in React Native apps. I dream about continuing my work on this lib; perhaps I hope to continue this project early 2021.
