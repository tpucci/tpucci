### Hi there; I'm Thomas 😁👋

#### 🔭 Currently working on

##### ACTIVE

- **[kstate](https://github.com/tpucci/kstate)** | A Kotlin multiplatform library to create [xstate](https://xstate.js.org/docs/) like state-machines on any platform (and planning to use it for a [no-nav app](https://app.livestorm.co/thiga-1/lpcx-online-comment-ameliorer-son-nps-grace-au-no-nav-retour-dexperience-avec-bam)).

##### ON HOLD

- **[react-nonav](https://github.com/tpucci/react-nonav)** | An experimental library to change the way we think about navigation in React Native apps. I dream about continuing my work on this lib; perhaps I hope to continue this project early 2021.
- **[cadence](https://cadence.tycho.cloud/signup)** | An experimental very early-stage and very secret project to experiment Elixir live views and [Commanded](https://leanpub.com/buildingconduit/read).
